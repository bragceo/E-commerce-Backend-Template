## How to run the application
We can use Insomnia Core to test API endpoints. 

Below is our step-by-step directions:

Download and Install Insomnia Core: 

Create a New Request: Open Insomnia Core, and click the '+' button on the left panel to create a new request. You'll be asked to give your request a name and select its type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Choose the one you want to test.

Enter Your API Endpoint: In the URL bar at the top, enter the URL of your API endpoint you want to test. For example, if you're testing your local server, it might look something like http://localhost:3001/api/categories.

Add Request Body (for POST and PUT): If you're creating a POST or PUT request, you'll need to send data in the request body. To do this, click on the 'Body' tab below the URL bar, select 'JSON' as the type, and enter your JSON data in the provided text field.

Send the Request: Once you've set up your request, click the 'Send' button to send it. Insomnia will then show the HTTP response in the right panel. This includes the status code, headers, and response body.

Review the Response: Check the HTTP status code in the response. Codes in the 200 range typically indicate success, while codes in the 400 or 500 range indicate an error. Also, look at the response body to see if the data returned (if any) is what you expected.

Repeat: Repeat steps 2-6 for all the routes and request types you want to test. You can create folders to organize your requests and even create environments to easily switch between different sets of variables.
